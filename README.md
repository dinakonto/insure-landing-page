# Frontend Mentor - Insure landing page

![Design preview for the Insure landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## What is this?
This is my response to a front-end coding challenge from Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor provides great development challenges alongside beautiful designs, enabling you to build your skills using realistic projects.

I plan to take on most, if not all, of the free challenges in order from easiest ('Newbie') to hardest ('Advanced').

## The challenge
**Challenge #12**
**Difficulty: Junior**

This challenge was to build out a landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My approach
I started by building out the basic **HTML** page structure, making sure the page layout made sense at a fundamental level, particularly for screenreader users.

I used **Sass** to easily implement elements from the `style-guide.md` provided. I then went through the page section-by-section, styling for mobile widths first before adding media queries for larger widths.

Lastly, I used simple Jquery and CSS classes to implement the responsive navigation.

The end product is hosted on Vercel - https://insure-landing-page-livid.vercel.app/
